Meeting Logs. Everyone is here.

Today we are starting development with Flutter. We all have Flutter downloaded and installed on our machines.

We are visualizing the three starting screens that we will develop first: the login page, the home screen where we can upload 

Uploaded document for what the app screens might look like.

Following tutorial to connect our app to a backend

That was just the first video. There is a whole tutorial we can follow to get the app paired with Firebase.
The creation of the login page itself is pretty simple, but the backend stuff is going to be more complicated.

For this week, we seem to have a basic idea of everything, and we have the general tools installed.

For next weekend, at the latest, we need to have a commit for our initial project. This will simply be a login page with two
username and password input fields, and then two different buttons, one for login and one for sign up.

The login and sign up buttons should take the user to a different page, it doesn't need to actually work.

After that, we will work on the firebase tutorials which we found a basic one on Youtube, or other tutorials / sample applications
that we can use to start working with Firebase. 

Here is another useful Flutter tutorial for Firebase.

Here is an example application using firebase that is helpful

And here is a simple login page for Firebase, starting with the demo application that Flutter starts us out with:

And another firebase tutorial/ example login page:

For those of us that want to go faster and not wait through the videos, the above links are helpful. But otherwise,
this seems like a really good and easy to follow video series that will get us through with a firebase app:

Another note. Because we want to finish the initial commit by next weekend, and because this first commit might be the most important
just since it has all the intro to Firebase and Flutter, we are all going to do it ourselves. We all have our own folders inside
our project_code repositories.

We will meet at our normal time next week, and discuss. We will keep in touch via groupMe if we have other questions too..
