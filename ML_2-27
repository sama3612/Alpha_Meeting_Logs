Meeting Logs for 2/27

We are going forward with the Flutter IDE.

We all have Flutter installed on our machines. For this next week, we are going to be working individually and build a basic
app that simply displays "Welcome to Link!". Step 2 is to create 2 tabs on the bottom of the page to display. After this, we can reconvene
during our lab time next week and discuss.
