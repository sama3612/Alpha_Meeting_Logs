Meeting Logs for February 20, 2020

We met today and discussed some tools that we would use to implement the application.
We decided on Google Flutter last week and we started setting up our machines with the application.

We decided our plan for this week, we will look into Google Firebase and get familiar with the develepment functionality and
 some basic tutorials.
 
 After that, we will regroup and decide on the application development tool, and keep Flutter if everyone is comfortable with it.
 Otherwise we are thinking about switching to a website so we will have more resources like TA's to go to for help with errors.
 
 Switching to a website might be helpful we think.
 
 Working on tutorials for the rest of the time meeting.
 
 Meeting at the same time next week.
