Everybody was here for the meeting.

We met and decided that to change platforms from flutter to html. We just felt that it'd be more convenient and more in line with
the labs we're doing in class. 

We all did the peer evaluations and felt that the work so far has been pretty fair. 

We decided on some goals for the demo next week, namely three pages. The login page, the home page, and a friends page. 
We also want to use the skills and database connection methods we learned in the lab this week to set up a framework for a database behind
our website. 

The database will be used to manage usernames, passwords, and timeslots. 

We'll use past labs and homework's as reference to start building this website.
